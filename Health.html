             The Democratic Republic of Congo has begun mpox (formerly known as monkeypox) vaccinations in 
             a bid to curb rising outbreaks. Health authorities are prioritizing high-risk areas,
             aiming to prevent the disease from spreading further. Mpox has re-emerged in several regions, and Congo’s 
             vaccination campaign is part of a broader effort to control the virus. The initiative also underscores the need 
             for swift responses to public health threats.

                Kinshasa – The Democratic Republic of the Congo today kicked off mpox vaccination, adding a vital measure to complement the ongoing outbreak control efforts to halt the spread of the viral disease and save lives. 

The vaccination, launched in the eastern North Kivu province, will prioritize health workers and frontline responders, contacts of confirmed cases, contacts of those contacts, and other at-risk groups. The vaccination will subsequently be rolled out in 11 of the most affected health zones in Equateur, North Kivu, Sankuru, South Kivu, Sud-Ubangi and Tshopo provinces.

The Democratic Republic of Congo has received 265 000 doses of the MVA-BN vaccine donated by the European Commission's Health Emergency Preparedness and Response Authority, Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, and the United States Government.

“As we rally efforts to stop the mpox outbreak, the rollout of the vaccine marks an important step in limiting the spread of the virus and ensuring the safety of families and communities,” said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa. “Vaccines are an important additional tool in outbreak control and we’re grateful to our partners who have donated the doses. We’re working closely with the national authorities to effectively deliver the vaccines to those who need them most.”

WHO recommends that vaccination be implemented as part of a comprehensive response that includes enhanced surveillance, community engagement, contact tracing, public health and social measures, and appropriate case management. WHO and partners are working closely with the national authorities to scale up and reinforce all the key control measures to save lives and end the outbreak. 

To further strengthen the ongoing outbreak response, more than 300 WHO experts supporting polio eradication efforts in the Democratic Republic of the Congo have been integrated in the mpox response. The experts have extensive field experience in public health, particularly in community-based and health-facility active surveillance, case investigations, contact tracing and risk communication, and have been at the forefront in the fight against polio and other vaccine-preventable diseases. 

In preparations for the mpox vaccination, WHO has supported the national health authorities in a range of areas, including training of health workers; enhancing vaccine delivery systems and infrastructure such as vaccine storage and transportation; community engagement; as well as ensuring supervision and evaluation of the process for quality vaccine delivery. Efforts are also ongoing to reinforce measures to identify and address vaccine mis- and disinformation and engage with community and religious leaders to increase access to accurate information. 

Mpox vaccines are currently in short supply, especially in Africa.

In September 2024, WHO added the MVA-BN as the first mpox vaccine to its prequalification list, a step that is expected to facilitate timely and increased access to this vital product in communities with urgent need, to reduce transmission and help contain the outbreak.

WHO is working with partners, including Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance and UNICEF, to establish a distribution mechanism for doses being donated by other countries as well as from direct procurements from the vaccine manufacturer.

The Democratic Republic of the Congo has reported more than 30 000 suspected and laboratory-confirmed cases, and 990 deaths since the start of 2024 – accounting for 90% of the cases reported from 15 countries in the African region so far this year.

            Since 2022, Quebec has brought in over a thousand foreign-trained nurses to tackle its healthcare labour shortage. 
            Like many Western nations, including France, poor working conditions have driven
             nurses away from the sector, prompting Quebec to look abroad for solutions.
              Under pressure from various countries concerned about losing their own nursing capacity,
             Quebec will cease recruitment from nearly all African nations.

            Since 2022, Quebec has brought in over a thousand foreign-trained nurses to tackle its healthcare labour shortage. Like many Western nations, including France, poor working conditions have driven nurses away from the sector, prompting Quebec to look abroad for solutions.

Under pressure from various countries concerned about losing their own nursing capacity, Quebec will cease recruitment from nearly all African nations.

Most of the nurses had been sourced from francophone countries like Cameroon, Côte d’Ivoire, and Morocco. Quebec will continue its recruitment programmes in Tunisia and from the Gulf region, Radio Canada reported.

Morocco welcomed the decision, with its ambassador to Canada Souriya Otmani calling it “just and fair”.
The country had described the recruitment scheme as a “dead loss” and has raised concerns about the cost of training nurses who subsequently leave for jobs elsewhere, impacting its own healthcare system.

Serious shortages
The World Health Organization has warned that 55 countries, 37 of which are in Africa, face serious healthcare worker shortages, urging Western nations to support these systems.

For context, Cameroon has 1.9 nurses per 10,000 residents, while Quebec boasts nearly 100, according to the WHO.

However, those recruited in Quebec often face challenges adapting to the healthcare system. Many struggle to pass exams and find themselves in lower-paying jobs in care homes.

Cultural barriers and instances of racism exacerbate these difficulties.

Since 2017, over 1,900 healthcare workers, including nurses and midwives from 24 African, Latin American, and European countries, have been recruited to work in Canada.
