   <img src="img/Rooney.webp" style="width: 700px; height: auto; margin-left: 520px;">
   <small style="margin-left: 520px;">
    Plymouth boss Wayne Rooney has discovered precisely why he was prevented from conducting interviews after a recent match
   </small>
   <h2 style="color: rgb(20, 20, 233); margin-left: 120px; margin-right: 120px;">WAYNE ROONEY LEARNS WHY HE WAS BANNED FROM INTERVIEW AFTER FURIOUS OUTBURST AND RED CARD</h2>
   <p style="margin-left: 120px; margin-right: 120px;">
    Rooney, 38, showed his discontent a little too vigorously over what he felt was a foul in the build-up to 
    Joe Rankin-Costello's equaliser for Rovers at Home Park.
    The Plymouth Argyle manager was given his marching orders during a Championship clash against Blackburn earlier in October. Rooney, 38, showed his discontent a little too vigorously over what he felt was a foul in the build-up to Joe Rankin-Costello's equaliser
     for Rovers at Home Park, and he was sent to the stands as a result.
   </p>

   <br>
   <p style="margin-left: 120px; margin-right: 120px;">
    However, the Manchester United icon was surprised to learn he wouldn't be allowed to conduct post-match interviews following his dismissal. But PGMOL chief and former Premier League referee Howard Webb was on hand to explain in detail why that was the case during the latest episode of The Overlap.

    "It's meant to protect the coach as well," replied Webb when Rooney suggested the protocol is in place simply to prevent officials from being criticised in public. But 'Wazza' pressed on and questioned the practice in place, suggesting he'd want to hear from the coach if he was a supporter.
    Webb then continued: "So there was a working group set up called the 'Participant Behaviour Working Group', and on there sat various representatives from different groups, including the League Managers Association. And collectively - I don't know what the exact view of the LMA was - collectively they decided if the coach is sent off, there'll be no media for that coach.

"I appreciate some coaches want to do it, but I think it was to protect the coach from saying something in the heat of the moment they might regret later."

Both Rooney and former United team-mate Roy Keane appeared to see reason in the judgement, with the latter agreeing it would let coaches "cool down" before voicing their opinions in public. Rooney is now facing a touchline ban for Plymouth's trip to Cardiff City on Saturday, where the Pilgrims hope to clinch consecutive wins for the first time since he took over.
Thankfully for Rooney - who was sent off eight times during his playing career - Morgan Whittaker's 97th-minute intervention spared his blushes at home to Blackburn. His Plymouth side are now up to 14th in the Championship standings after failing to win any of their first five league fixtures under the Old Trafford hero.
Even without a post-match interview, a major name like Rooney is fortunate to still have his platforms to ask these questions. And it's just as well considering the ex-England striker appears to be no less prone to passionately challenging officials these days.

   <small style="margin-left: 120px; margin-right: 120px;">William Orgertrice says he would prepare differently for Meta's technical interview if given another opportunity. Khayla McClinton</small>
   <br>
   <P style="margin-left: 120px; margin-right: 120px;">
    I received an email from one of Meta's recruiters in March asking me to apply for a data engineering position. The recruiter said they'd found my LinkedIn profile and thought I had the experience they were looking for.

    The timing couldn't have been more perfect. I'd just received the news I was going to be laid off from my data engineering job at a staffing agency, with an official end date of April 1, so I had newly re-entered the job hunt.
   </P>
   <img src="img/mme.jpg" style="width: 400px; margin-left: 125px; margin-right: 120px;" >  <img src="img/met.jpg" style="width: 400px; margin-left: 120px; margin-right: 120px;" ><br>
   <br>
   <p style="margin-left: 120px; margin-right: 120px;">
    I successfully made it through Meta's preliminary phone screening and spent the next two weeks preparing for the next round, 
    a technical interview, with everything from mock interviews to practice questions.
     I felt confident going into my interview. But I still got rejected.
     I'm proud of myself for making it to the second round, but if I could do it over again, I would take a different approach.

     I was notified that I passed the first round of interviews at Meta right away
     During the preliminary phone screening, the recruiter asked about my work experience, the technologies I was familiar with, and if I'd be willing to relocate to work out of one of Meta's main headquarters. I was living in Atlanta but said I'd be willing to move to the Menlo Park office for the opportunity.
     
     I've been in data engineering for five years and primarily used Python, Java, and SQL.
     
     At the end of the call, the recruiter told me I'd be moving on to the next round, a one-hour technical interview with a data engineer from the team.
     I spent two weeks preparing for my coding interview
I scheduled my interview two weeks out because I wanted to give myself enough time to study while moving quickly, given my impending layoff; however, I had the autonomy to choose how far out I wanted my interview to be.

I created an official Meta career profile on metacareer.com, which gave me access to a portal with interview prep resources, such as a breakdown of the Meta interview process and LeetCode-type practice questions for different programming languages.

Each applicant can choose a language preference, and I chose Python because it's the language I've primarily worked with in my career. I also watched YouTube videos with coding question breakdowns and studied practice questions on Blind 75, to familiarize myself with the most frequently asked LeetCode questions.

I studied anywhere from 30 minutes to two hours each day leading up to the interview.
