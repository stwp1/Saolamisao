                    Like A Resort In Rural Zimbabwe. Women in Matobo district decorate and paint their homes using mud and ashes to give <br>
                    their homes a new look during winter. The designs draw local and <br>
                    international tourists who marvel at the indigenous works of art. The annual contest shines a light on the Ndebele matrilineal tradition of home painting using natural materials like ash, clay, and ant hill soil.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Peggy Masuku put the finishing touches on the welcome sign to her homestead in south-western Zimbabwe's Matobo district. She surveyed her handiwork, six months of designing and painting her huts in anticipation of an annual competition, My Beautiful Home, which recognizes the most beautiful traditionally decorated homes in the district.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It was a one-woman effort – with some constructive criticism from her husband – to decorate the homestead's huts in patterns of brown, black, red, and grey. Adorned, they stood out among the orange and lemon trees and the rock garden dotted with native aloes and cactus plants.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In Ndebele culture, hut decoration is solely a women's duty and the secrets of the traditional patterns and the making of natural paints have been passed from one generation to the next for hundreds of years. As a young girl, Masuku learnt how to design patterns and paint huts from her mother. Now she only designs what she feels. "I listen to the walls as I work and I feel like they tell me what sort of shape I must put," she said. "There's a feeling you get when you create art and that's what guides me as I put designs on the walls."

      A BOAT IN NORTH KIVU DR CONGO SHIPWRECKS
  </h2>
    <div class="image image-sm mb-1">
        <img class="thumb" src="img/nord kivu.jpg" alt="North Kivu Image" style="display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 20px; width: 800px; margin-left: 400px;"><br>

        At least 78 people have drowned and many more are missing after a boat believed to be carrying 278 passengers capsized on Thursday morning just a few hundred metres from the shore of Lake Kivu in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
    </p>
    
    <img src="img/bo.jpg" alt="Boat Image 1" style="margin-left: 400px; margin-right: 200px; margin-top: 40px; margin-bottom: 40px; width: 350px;">
    <img src="img/boa.jpg" alt="Boat Image 2" style="margin-top: 40px; margin-bottom: 40px; width: 350px;"><br>

    <p>
        The accident happened just as the vessel, MV Merdy, was about to dock at the port of Kituku, just outside the city of Goma, after crossing the lake from the town of Minova. Many watching the disaster unfold from the landing pier were waiting to meet friends and family onboard or were traders from the nearby market.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Reports say 278 people were onboard the boat, which was built to carry only 80 people, according to survivors who spoke to the Guardian. The governor of South Kivu province said the death toll was 78 so far and that 278 had been onboard. “It’ll take at least three days to get the exact numbers, because not all the bodies have been found yet,” Jean-Jacques Purisi told Reuters.
    </p>

    <p>
        The route across Lake Kivu has become overcrowded and increasingly used because fighting in the region between government forces and the M23 rebels has made roads dangerous or impassable. Between Goma and Minova, lorries transporting food and other supplies are being stopped or raided, forcing many traders to transport goods across Lake Kivu. The insecurity has also pushed the cost of road transport beyond most people’s reach.
    </p>

    <p>
        Nuru Alpha, 27, lives in Goma. Twelve of his family members were onboard the boat; he had been awaiting their arrival for several days. “On this ship, I had family members. Unfortunately, two of them died. Three are in hospital, and I haven’t heard from seven others so far,” he said.
